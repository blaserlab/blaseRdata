# blaseRdata

This is a companion dataset for the blaseRtools package of functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of blaseRdata like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("blaserlab/blaseRdata")
```
However, blaseRdata is installed as a dependency of blaseRtools so if you are using it with blaseRtools functions, you don't need to install it separately.

## Example

This is an example of how you would use the package.:

``` r
blaseRtools::bb_grcz11_ape("prkcda")
```
